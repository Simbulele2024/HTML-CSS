<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<ul>
<li>HyperText Markup Language is the foundation of everything digital as it serves as a channel for different types of content</li><br> 
<li>HTML is straightforward as it is a declarative language that gives it it's simplicity.</li>
<li>HTML uses tags to markup different elements as it is a language used to structure web pages</li>
<li>HTML markup is a bridge or connection between the human world and computers it achieves this by giving meaning to content and helping computers understand it</li><br>
<li>When nesting elements to each other you need to pay attention to how you open and close tags as this helps convey meaning about the content and interface <br>
<li>HTML elements marking up headlines come in six different types and they convey a hierarchy in how the browser interprets the page.<br>
<li>This hierarchical system is used distingsh what is most important from what is less important, this helps users easily navigate the page<br>
<li>Tags come in # HTML-CSStwo types, open < p> and closed< /p> these tags work together to define elements<br>
<li>Some paragraphs have an emphasized tag < em> and </ em><br>
<li>Headline tags are i hierarchical form for example < h1> </ h1> to < h6></ h6> with h6 being the smallest<br> 
<li>We use the < p> tag to tell the browser to separate the paragraphs<br>
<li>There are two elements for bold and there are two for italic
for Bold we use < b> and < strong> and for italic we you < i> and < em><br>
<li>We also use a definition list that uses the tags < dl> but yet for definations that are specific we use different tags like< dt> for defination term<br>
<li>For a defination description we use the tags < dd><br>
<li>HTML elements also help us cover qoutes
<li>For us to be able to attribute the person who said the words we use < cite> element after doing that we wrap the whole thing up with < blockqoute> element these elements are used for interpretation as they provide a convinient wayto apply customer styling <br>
<li>HTML attributes addmore to HTML elements for exsmple datetime attributes allow us to write specific time and date in a way that allows the compute to understand like <time datetime="2024-03-07">March 7, 2024</time>.</ul><br><br>
<h2>HTML Capabilities: Troubleshooting and Debugging</h2><br><br>
<li>In HTML involves identifying issues that may arise in your web pages. Validation: ensures your HTML code follows specifications by using online validation services.</li>
<li>HTML attributes: are used to define the characteristics of elements. 
All HTML tags have some attributes along with some default values.
The attributes are usually made up of two parts, the name and value (name= "value"). 
For example, if you want to change the background colour to red, bicolor will be your name and value will be red.</li>


  
<br><br>
<h2>Working with Forms and Interactive Elements</h2><br>
<li>HTML Form is a section of the document that collects input from the user.</li>
<li>A form contains special interactive elements that users use to insert data.</li>
<li>The HTML < input> tag defines the field where the user can enter data.</li>
<li>type - determines the type of input the <input> tag takes.<br><br>
 # Types of inputs include text, date, email, button, checkbox etc.</li><br><br>
 <h2>HTML Form Action:POST and GET</h2><br><br>
 <li>The method attribute in the form element specifies how the data is sent to the server.</li>
 <li>Using the < action> attribute. define the action to be performed when the form is submitted. It is usually the URL for the server where the form data is to be sent.</li>
 <li>GET method - used to request data from a specified resource.</li>
 <li>POST method - used to send data to a server to update a resource.</li><br><br>
 <h1>Introduction to CSS.</h1><br>
 <p>CSS is used to make web pages look better and more appealing.<br>
It stands for Cascading Style Sheets.<br>
We can style the web pages by changing fonts, colors and spacing.</p><br><br>
<h2>CSS synta:</h2><br><br>
<h4>CSS has two parts:<br></h4>
<li>The selector-which points to the html elements you want to style.</li>
<li>The declaration box- which contains one or more declarations separated by a semicolon.</li><br><br>
<h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
<h4>CSS selectors can be divided into five categories:</h4><br><br>
<li>Simple selectors</li>
<li>Combinator selectors</li>
<li>Pseudo class selectors</li>
<li>Pseudo element selectors</li>
<li>Attribute selectors</li><br><br>
<h2>The CSS element selector</h2>
The element selector selects the html elements based on the element name.<br.
Example:  p: {text-align: center; color: blue; }<br>
Here all the <p> elements will be center aligned, with a blue text color.<br><br>
<h2>The CSS Id selector</h2>

<li>The Id selector selects the html element with specific Id attribute.</li>
<li>It is written with the (#) character, followed by the Id of the element.</li><br><br>
<h2>The CSS class selector</h2><br><br>
<li>The CSS class Selector selects the Html elements with a specific class attribute.</li>
<li>To select elements with specific class, write a period character (.), followed by the class name.</li><br><br>
<h2>Grouping selectors</h2>
<li>The group selector is used to select all the elements with the same style definition.</li>
<li>Commas are used to separate each selector in grouping.</li><br><br>
<h2>CSS Images & Colours</h2><br>
<li>The background-color property sets the background color of an element.</li> 
<li>It applies to the entire size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin). </li>
<li> To ensure readability, choose a background color that contrasts well with the text color.</li><br><br>
<h2>The syntax for setting the background color</h2><br>
<li>Altering the color of the text can add visual interest or align with a specific design scheme.</li>
  <li> The color property is used to set the color of the text.</li><br><br>
  <h2>Understanding Images in CSS</h2><br>
 <li> <b>JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group):</b> It uses lossy compression, meaning that the image quality may be slightly degraded in order to reduce file size.</li>

<li><b>PNG (Portable Network Graphics):</b> PNG images use lossless compression, meaning that image quality is preserved without sacrificing file size. </li>

<li><b> GIF (Graphics Interchange Format):</b> GIF images support transparency and animation, making them popular for memes and social media content.</li>

The syntax for setting the back-ground image:
       body{
          background-image:url(‘the.png’);
          }<br><br>
<h2>CSS Boxes, Sizes & Types</h2>
<li>The fonts, height, width, margins, padding, etc. are set on a web page with the length units. For example, height 100px, width 100px, font 2em, etc. </li>
<li>These length units are categorised into Absolute and Relative Units.</li>
<li>CSS uses a box model to define the size of elements on a web page.</li>
<br><br>
<h2>What is Python?</h2>
Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language.<br> Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, and Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.<br> Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber…<br>

<h2>Python Data Types</h2>
<li>Strings</li>
<li>Numbers</li>
<li>Booleans</li>
<li>Python List</li>
<li>Python Tuples</li>
<li>Python Sets</li>
<li>Python Dictionary</li>
<li>Python Arrays</li>
<li>Type Casting</li>
