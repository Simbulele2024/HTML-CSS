<strong>What is HTML?</strong>
<ul>
<li>HyperText Markup Language is the foundation of everything digital as it serves as a channel for different types of content</li><br> 
<li>HTML is straightforward as it is a declarative language that gives it it's simplicity.</li>
<li>HTML uses tags to markup different elements as it is a language used to structure web pages</li>
<li>HTML markup is a bridge or connection between the human world and computers it achieves this by giving meaning to content and helping computers understand it</li><br>
<li>When nesting elements to each other you need to pay attention to how you open and close tags as this helps convey meaning about the content and interface <br>
<li>HTML elements marking up headlines come in six different types and they convey a hierarchy in how the browser interprets the page.<br>
<li>This hierarchical system is used distingsh what is most important from what is less important, this helps users easily navigate the page<br>
<li>Tags come in # HTML-CSStwo types, open < p> and closed< /p> these tags work together to define elements<br>
<li>Some paragraphs have an emphasized tag < em> and </ em><br>
<li>Headline tags are i hierarchical form for example < h1> </ h1> to < h6></ h6> with h6 being the smallest<br> 
<li>We use the < p> tag to tell the browser to separate the paragraphs<br>
<li>There are two elements for bold and there are two for italic
for Bold we use < b> and < strong> and for italic we you < i> and < em><br>
<li>We also use a definition list that uses the tags < dl> but yet for definations that are specific we use different tags like< dt> for defination term<br>
<li>For a defination description we use the tags < dd><br>
<li>HTML elements also help us cover qoutes
<li>For us to be able to attribute the person who said the words we use < cite> element after doing that we wrap the whole thing up with < blockqoute> element these elements are used for interpretation as they provide a convinient wayto apply customer styling <br>
<li>HTML attributes addmore to HTML elements for exsmple datetime attributes allow us to write specific time and date in a way that allows the compute to understand like <time datetime="2024-03-07">March 7, 2024</time>.</ul>
